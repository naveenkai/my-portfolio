    excerpt: 'On working harder than people think you should, the unfairness of life, and why compound effort matters—without going too hard on yourself.',
    content: `People say you shouldn't work all the time in your early 20s. Which is true. But I feel you should work harder than people think you should. We don't understand how unfair life is. We are born with different starting lines in an immature society. Sometimes you get lucky, but most of the time you don't.

Working hard maximizes your chances of success. It compounds over time. You get better opportunities and leverage from your hard work.

Don't just jump in, to take some random path, and end up spending a lot of time there. It is really hard to unlearn and come back from that to explore other paths. And a lot of time drain! We should spend enough time making big decisions, like choosing the people and the work we want to work on.

You should definitely respect patterns sometimes!

But it is a bad idea to go too hard on yourself.
It's not what you achieve, but what you manage to achieve with what you have. You should keep that in check and allow yourself to enjoy.

But work hard to your max if you can't afford to depend on luck.
